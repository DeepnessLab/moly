== Overview ==

The Razorback SaaC preprocessor monitors SMTP and HTTP streams and extracts
documents that are forwarded to a Razorback dispatcher for analysis.  HTTP
streams have a destination port of 80 and SMTP streams have a destination port
of 25.

== Configuration ==

The only configuration that is accepted is rzb_conf <file name>
By default, all alerts are disabled and the preprocessor checks traffic on port
22.

The available configuration options are described below:

* rzb_conf <filename>

This option specifies the name and location of the Razorback configuration file.
