# Generate the "official" Snort.org RPMs.

# The following will build 3 binary and 1 source RPM as follows:
#	snort-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm
#	snort-mysql-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm
#	snort-postgresql-x.x.x-x.i386.rpm
#	snort-x.x.x-x.src.rpm
#
# mysql and postgresql are probably mutually exclusive when building for
# your own use, and flexresp is optional.  We therefor encourage you to
# build your own RPMs as you see fit.  See README.build_rpms.

# If you wish to build with Oracle support, you need to use --with-oracle
# for the build syntax, and have your client libraries installed in 
# /opt/oracle

rpmbuild -bb --target i386 --with mysql --with postgresql snort.spec 
rpmbuild -bs --target i386 snort.spec

# If you wish to build with Inline support, you need to use the 
# --with inline build syntax. You will need iptables-devel (for libipq)
# and libnet installed.

# The following will build the above binary packages with Inline support:

#rpmbuild -bb --target i386 --with inline --with mysql --with postgresql snort.spec
