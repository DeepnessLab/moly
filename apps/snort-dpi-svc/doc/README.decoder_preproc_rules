Decoder and Preprocessor Rule Eventing
======================================

Decoder and preprocessor rules allow one to enable and disable decoder
and preprocessor events on a rule by rule basis.  They also allow one
to specify the rule type or action of a decoder or preprocessor event
on a rule by rule basis.

Decoder config options will still determine whether or not to generate
decoder events.  For example, if 'config disable_decode_alerts' is in 
snort.conf, decoder events will not be generated regardless of whether
or not there are corresponding rules for the event.  Also note that if
the decoder is configured to enable drops, e.g.
'config enable_decode_drops', these options will take precedence
over the event type of the rule.  A packet will be dropped if either a 
decoder config drop option is in snort.conf or the decoder or
preprocessor rule type is 'drop'.  Of course, the drop cases only
apply if Snort is running inline.  See 'doc/README.decode' for config
options that control decoder events.


Configuring
===========
The decoder and preprocessor rules are located in the 'preproc_rules/'
directory in the top level source tree, and have the names 
'decoder.rules' and 'preprocessor.rules' respectively.  These files
are updated as new decoder and preprocessor events are added to Snort.

To enable these rules in snort.conf, define the path to where the rules
are located and uncomment the 'include' lines in snort.conf that
reference the rules files:

var PREPROC_RULE_PATH /path/to/preproc_rules
...
include $PREPROC_RULE_PATH/preprocessor.rules
include $PREPROC_RULE_PATH/decoder.rules

To disable any rule, just comment it with a '#' or remove the rule
completely from the file (commenting is recommended).

To change the rule type or action of a decoder/preprocessor rule,
just replace 'alert' with the desired rule type.  Any one of the
following rule types can be used:

alert
log
pass
drop
sdrop
reject

For example one can change:

alert ( msg: "DECODE_NOT_IPV4_DGRAM"; sid: 1; gid: 116; rev: 1; \
    metadata: rule-type decode ; classtype:protocol-command-decode;)

to

drop ( msg: "DECODE_NOT_IPV4_DGRAM"; sid: 1; gid: 116; rev: 1; \
    metadata: rule-type decode ; classtype:protocol-command-decode;)

to drop (as well as alert on) packets where the Ethernet protocol is IPv4
but version field in IPv4 header has a value other than 4.

See README.decode, README.gre and the various preprocessor READMEs for
descriptions of the rules in 'decoder.rules' and 'preprocessor.rules'.


Reverting to original behavior
==============================
The following config option in snort.conf will make Snort revert to the old
behavior:

config autogenerate_preprocessor_decoder_rules

Note that if you want to revert to the old behavior, you also have to
remove the decoder and preprocessor rules and any reference to them from
snort.conf, otherwise they will be loaded.  This option applies to rules
not specified and the default behavior is to alert.


Suppression and Thresholding
============================
The use of decoder and preprocessor rules does not change suppression
and thresholding behavior.
